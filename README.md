# ML-from-Scratch-to-DeepLearning

A collection of my **end-to-end Machine Learning implementations** built using **Python** and **Google Colab**.  
Each project focuses on a core ML concept — from regression and classification to deep learning and association rule mining.  

These implementations helped me understand not just the algorithms but also **data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation**, and **interpretability**.

## 📚 Projects Overview

| # | Project                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      | Dataset Used                     |
| - | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1 | 🧮 **Linear Regression**                | Built a predictive model to estimate sales based on advertising spend using both *Simple* and *Multiple Linear Regression*. Includes data visualization and model evaluation metrics (R², RMSE). | `Advertising.csv`                |
| 2 | 🧩 **Classification Models**            | Implemented multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) to predict whether a user purchases a product based on demographics such as Age and Estimated Salary.                 | `Social_Network_Ads.csv`         |
| 3 | 👥 **Customer Clustering**              | Performed customer segmentation using *K-Means* and *Hierarchical Clustering* to group mall customers by spending and income behavior.                                                           | `Mall_Customers.csv`             |
| 4 | ⚡ **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**   | Developed a feed-forward neural network using *TensorFlow/Keras* to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset. Included data normalization, one-hot encoding, and performance evaluation.      | `Churn_Modelling.csv`            |
| 5 | 🛒 **Market Basket Analysis (Apriori)** | Implemented the *Apriori algorithm* to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules in transactional data for product recommendation insights.                                                | `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv` |
